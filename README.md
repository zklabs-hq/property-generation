# Property Generation
Goal - Automated Property Generation for smart contracts.
1. Invariant Generation
2. Automated Test Generation
3. Formal Specs Generation

## Invariant Generation
Currently we follow templates based structure for invariants. We supprt ERC20 tokens. Adding more templates as we go. Developers can use this template as a cookie cutter, change the values to fit their need and then we generate invariants for them.
  Based on - Slither Property Generation

## Automated Test Generation
Using DynaMOSA algorithm to traverse the CGF and generate viable test cases for functions allowing high code coverage.

## Formal Specs Generation
This too will be template based for now. Just like Invariant generation
